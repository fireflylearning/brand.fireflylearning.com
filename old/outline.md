The main adjectives.

## Brand elements

### The name of the company

The full, legal name of the company is Firefly Learning LLP. Use this form in all footers of emails and letters, and wherever else the full legal name of the company is required. In practice, you won't need to use this form in normal use.

Whenever you mention the company in emails, letters or any publicity, just call it Firefly.

[Overlaps with voice]

Firefly is referred to in the plural as 'us' or 'we':

* At Firefly we have a deep understanding of technology in education.
* Work with us at Firefly to better create, share and learn.

Firefly is always written with a capital 'F'. The logo is all in lowercase, but that's the logo. Whenever you write it, it is Firefly.

### Colour

The main colour for Firefly is red.

The specific shade of red you use depends on what you're using it for.

For print, we have two ways of describing our red:

Pantone 187C
CMYK 0 91 72 23

The first is a Pantone reference - Pantone is a standardised system of colours that are used worldwide. When you use a Pantone reference it means that anyone can look that up and give you an exact match, no matter where they are.

The Pantone reference for Firefly red is 187C. The 'C' stands for 'coated' - i.e. the print will be varnished and have a shiny or satin appearance. This varnish makes the colour appear richer and deeper. We don't have an 'uncoated' reference.

Pantone is used only for print, and then only when you're commissioning branded work specifically for us. Don't give this reference to anyone who is doing digital work for us.

Pantone references are often called 'spot colour' by printing companies. If you're asked for one, this is what you give them.

The second is known as a process colour. This is because the colour is made by a process of mixing a proportion of cyan, magenta, yellow and black. This is what you'll usually provide and be asked for when sending our logo or any brand elements out to be printed - usually for newspapers, co-branded stuff like sponsorships and so on.


For any on-screen work, the Firefly red is:

Hexadecimal:		#AC1D1D
Decimal:			172,29,29

Hexadecimal was originally only used in HTML and CSS for the web but is now used as a way of communicating colours for a wide variety of applications. The decimal is also often still used in graphics tools.

Other colours

We use a blue colour as an accent. This is:

Hexadecimal:  #2081c4
Decimal:			32, 129, 196

The Firefly Learning conference uses green:

Hexadecimal: #46ae57
Decimal:     70, 174, 87

In the banner there's a gradient effect from the above colour at the end to a central 'glow' of:

Hexadecimal: #5dc974
Decimal:     93, 201, 116

Text colours

For white backgrounds:

Normal body text should be dark grey:

Hexadecimal: #333333
Decimal: 		 51, 51, 51

Headlines can be Firefly red.
Quotes and paragraphs that need calling out can be Firefly red.

With Firefly red as the background colour all text should be white only.

### Logo

The logo is available in several styles.

The red logo and the red logo with the colour gradient are designed for use on white backgrounds only.

The white logo is designed for use on (ideally) red backgrounds, or darker and soft-focus photography.

The black logo is only for use when colour is impossible, such as black and white printing, e-books and other monochrome displays.

The first-choice logo is this one:

[wide, colour gradient]

In space-constrained layouts you may use this one:

[square, colour gradient]

Where the brand has been established, such as with the brochure, the logo symbol may be used on its own.

The logo symbol may be used as an icon in the Firefly user interface (such as the top bar) and as corner detail in brochures and paged publications.

As solid 3D text on signage, the wide, white logo is preferred, against a good match of the Firefly red.

The full range of logos:

* Wide flat colour
* Wide gradient colour
* Wide white
* Wide black
* Square flat colour
* Square gradient colour
* Square white
* Square black
* Logo only flat colour
* Logo only gradient
* Logo only white
* Logo only black

The logotype 'firefly' must never be used on its own.

### The font

The Firefly brand font is Akko. This is used for all print and things that are 'like' print - such as PDFs of sales proposals and invoices.

We have a licence for use on our machines of Akko Standard, which covers the Western European languages.

If you need to use the font for languages from further regions (Eastern Europe, Asia, etc.) we can additionally licence Akko Pro, which has broader support.

The standard font to use is Akko Light. For emphasis use Akko Italic. In place of bold use Akko Regular and Akko Regular Italic.

Only ever use italic for actual emphasis or for non-English words. Never set any headlines or paragraphs in italic.

For the web and intranet the brand font is Adelle. We use this as a web font provided by Fonts.com. Other fonts services can also provide the font.

For headlines, use Adelle Bold.
For body text, use Adelle Regular.


### Typography

Headings, sub-headings and body text should relate to each other so that it's clear to the reader where they are in the document. Main headings should be larger and bolder or made to stand out using colour, and sub-headings proportionally less so. There should be little confusion over what is what.

[examples of what this means]

All text, including headlines should always be left aligned.

Some quotes and paragraphs can be right aligned if it suits the design and they're on the right hand side of a page or layout.

Do not ever centre text. It makes documents hard to scan and creates a chaotic 'bitty' appearance to the layout.

Do not ever justify text. Text is justified by altering the spacing between lines and words so that the left and right margins are straight. These adjustments mean more work for the eye to interpret - jumping between spaced out, then squashed, text - than regularly set text would.

Bold text can be used to call attention to individual words and for subheadings in a longer document.

Italic text should only be used for emphasising short runs of text, quotes, or where a non-English word is used.

Do not ever italicise headlines.

Margins and line length

Very short or very long lines of text are hard to read. There is no definite set rule, but aim for around 60–80 characters, roughly 12–15 words.

Paragraphs do not have indented first lines are are separated vertically by the height of one line.

Keep line-heights to be roughly 150% of the font size. Again, there's no perfect rule for this, but avoid lines too far apart that the paragraph doesn't look like one thing anymore, or lines too close that characters such as y and j can clash with b and l below them.

For leaflets, brochures and other professionally-printed work, pay attention to the details of the typesetting before sending it to print. Avoid having single words left on their own line at the end of paragraphs or when carried over to a new page. Generally avoid hyphenation too as automatic hyphenation can give odd results.

Quotations such as testimonials can be made to look different from the main body text, but try to vary only one thing. We typically set quotations in red when the body type is the dark grey. If the quote is attributed, set that in italic, right aligned to the right margin of the quote if possible and appropriate.

[show examples of this]

Icons within text should be set so that they do not affect the line spacing of paragraphs and are roughly the same height as text characters.

Bulleted text needs care to make sure the reader can distinguish each item clearly, but the whole list should be viewable as one block. Try separating list items with half the vertical space you would use between paragraphs. The bullets can be exdented so that the left margin of the text aligns with paragraphs, or they can be indented so there is a clear change in margin. Either style is fine, but stick to just one in each document.

### Icons

The Firefly brand has a large library of icons used to illustrate the features of and concepts embodied in the software.

We have a set of patterns that use the icons (see below).

Icons can be used with text to illustrate concepts and features in Firefly. Use the icons appropriately and check with this list to avoid using them for the wrong things.

Usual rules apply - don't stretch the icons or redraw them in any way. If you need new icons then check with Firefly design before creating them - they may already exist.

### Patterns & Textures

#### Red background

Firefly has a set of red patterned backgrounds. The patterns are created from elements of the logo and are an important way of adding texture and decoration to designs.

Elements can be moved if necessary (but try to avoid doing so), but make sure all elements are connected to an edge. The wing elements in particular should appear to come from the right hand edge of the design, and the body elements should be connected to the top and bottom. The different elements have variations of the Firefly red and use layer modes in Illustrator to create depth and pattern.

If the pattern background is part of the design, you should not use the Pantone reference for any part that is overlapping it.

#### Icon pattern

We have pre-built icon patterns for general use and for specific events. Try not to alter any of these.

If you need to create a new pattern, take care to match the balance and even variation of icon types and opacities across the design.

Don't overlap icons. Ensure even spacing between all of them.

Vary sizes and opacities, but don't create extremes of either.

Often there will be a 'key' icon to mark a specific event - this should be set aligned with the title and at a complementary size and style as the text.

### Boxes, containers and outlines

If information needs to be 'called out', try using text styles and alignment first.

If you need to box-out an item, the box should ideally not float on the page, try to anchor it to something.

Borders should be subtly rounded. The idea is to match the roundedness of the brand font Akko. So no bouncy bubbles or sharp edges.

Boxes can be red when the page is white, or white when the page is red. For specific events other colours are used, but refer to the guidelines for those events in that case.

Border widths should always complement the stroke widths of the text.

## Using the Brand

### Basic principles

Firefly's brand is one that emphasises clarity and straightforwardness. In a visual sense:

Layouts should be simple and clear. Pages, leaflets, posters and spreads in brochures should have one clear message, with the minimum of design elements necessary to support that. Nothing should feel vague or accidental.

Counterpoint and balance are key to Firefly layouts. Aim for asymmetric layouts balanced by a bold quote or a graphical element. White space can be used to add liveliness and movement to a flow of text. An increased or decreased margin on a key paragraph or quote can draw the eye to important points and aid reading by providing visual landmarks.

Firefly uses patterns and textures as decorative elements. They are designed to work in large linear panels that span layouts and provide an anchor for the headings and body type.

Icons should be used meaningfully - they are designed to illustrate specific things. Grouped together they can provide an attractive pattern (as above) or show off the breadth of features in Firefly. Used individually they should be connected to text that specifically described the feature they relate to. Don't scatter them about.

The red and white are the key colours of Firefly. We use a blue to emphasise links and interactive elements online. In print we use the blue on screenshots and other product-elements (such as app icons) but not for page layouts or design elements themselves.
